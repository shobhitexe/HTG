          For Hera Trading Capital, the following trading practices are strictly
          prohibited:
          <br />
          1. Unrealistic Trading Opportunities: This includes exploiting
          unrealistic prices or trade opportunities such as arbitrage, latency
          exploitation, front-running price feeds, or any mispricing tactics.
          <br />
          2. Latency Trading: Trading based on latency advantages is not
          allowed.
          <br />
          3. Arbitrage Trading: Engaging in arbitrage trading methods is
          prohibited.
          <br />
          4. High-Frequency Trading (HFT): High-frequency trading practices are
          not permitted.
          <br />
          5. Reverse Trading Hedging: Strategies involving reverse trading or
          hedging are disallowed.
          <br />
          6. Order Book Spamming: Manipulating the order book by spamming is
          strictly prohibited.
          <br />
          <br />
          Additionally, account management services are not allowed. All
          accounts and trades must be conducted by the individual whose name is
          on the account.

          Order Book Spamming Defined
          <br />
          <br />
          Order book spamming is a manipulative trading tactic where a trader
          places a large number of orders in the order book to give the false
          appearance of high market activity or certain price trends. This
          practice aims to mislead other traders by creating artificial
          pressure, potentially influencing their trading decisions.
          <br />
          <br />
          Reasons for Prohibiting Order Book Spamming
          <br />
          <br />
          1. Unfair Advantage: By using this tactic, traders can gain an unfair
          edge over others, especially in a simulated environment where the
          consequences are less immediate than in live trading. This undermines
          both the fairness and the integrity of the trading platform. <br />
          2. System Strain: Excessive orders put significant pressure on trading
          platforms, leading to system delays, decreased performance, and
          potential instability in market operations. This disrupts trading
          efficiency for all users, resulting in slower response times and a
          poorer experience overall.
          <br />
          <br />
          Prohibiting order book spamming helps maintain a level playing field,
          ensuring both market integrity and optimal system performance.
          <br />
          <br />
