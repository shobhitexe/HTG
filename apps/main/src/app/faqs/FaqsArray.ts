    que: "What are prohibited trading strategies?",
    ans: `For Hera Trading Capital, the following trading practices are strictly prohibited:<br/><br/>
1. Unrealistic Trading Opportunities: This includes exploiting unrealistic prices or trade
opportunities such as arbitrage, latency exploitation, front-running price feeds, or any
mispricing tactics.<br/>
2. Latency Trading: Trading based on latency advantages is not allowed.<br/>
3. Arbitrage Trading: Engaging in arbitrage trading methods is prohibited.<br/>
4. High-Frequency Trading (HFT): High-frequency trading practices are not permitted.<br/>
5. Reverse Trading/Group Hedging: Strategies involving reverse trading or group
hedging are disallowed.<br/>
6. Order Book Spamming: Manipulating the order book by spamming is strictly prohibited.<br/><br/>
Additionally, account management services are not allowed. All accounts and trades must be
conducted by the individual whose name is on the account.<br/><br/>If you're uncertain about whether your EA or manual scalping strategy is compliant, please
reach out to us before you start trading.<br/><br/>For traders aiming for a qualified analyst account up to $300,000, it is critical to thoroughly
understand these rules, objectives, and requirements to maximize your success with us.<br/><br/>Order Book Spamming Defined<br/><br/>
Order book spamming is a manipulative trading tactic where a trader places a large number of
orders in the order book to give the false appearance of high market activity or certain price
trends. This practice aims to mislead other traders by creating artificial pressure, potentially
influencing their trading decisions.<br/><br/>Reasons for Prohibiting Order Book Spamming<br/>
1. Unfair Advantage: By using this tactic, traders can gain an unfair edge over others,
especially in a simulated environment where the consequences are less immediate than
in live trading. This undermines both the fairness and the integrity of the trading platform.<br/>
2. System Strain: Excessive orders put significant pressure on trading platforms, leading
to system delays, decreased performance, and potential instability in market operations.
This disrupts trading efficiency for all users, resulting in slower response times and a
poorer experience overall.<br/><br/>Prohibiting order book spamming helps maintain a level playing field, ensuring both market
integrity and optimal system performance.<br/><br/>At Hera Trading Capital, we enforce strict measures to maintain a fair and compliant trading
environment. Violating any of our policies will result in the following actions:<br/>1. Immediate Termination: Hera Trading Capital reserves the right to terminate your
account and agreement immediately if any prohibited trading practice is detected.<br/>
2. Forfeiture of Profits: Any profits generated through prohibited practices will be
considered void and will not be distributed.<br/>
3. Evaluation Review and Disqualification: All passed evaluations are subject to review.

    que: "Can I trade news?",
    ans: `Traders are free to place trades during news events across Phase 1 or Phase 2 of the
evaluation for all account types offered. However, since our simulated platform tracks real-world
market data, traders should be mindful of the risks associated with slippage during these
high-volatility periods.<br/><br/>
To clarify, trading during news events is not a violation of Hera Trading Capital's rules during the
evaluation. However, traders must understand that slippage—just as in a live market—can
occur, and it is the trader's responsibility if slippage results in a breach of the maximum loss
limits.<br/><br/>
Hera Trading Capital cannot guarantee profits during such high-risk events, nor can we prevent
potential losses if a trade fails to execute as expected or results in slippage, impacting your
simulated account's performance.<br/><br/>
Our simulated platform mirrors real market conditions closely. Just as slippage is a natural risk
in live trading, it is also present on our platform. For this reason, we recommend avoiding trades
during major news events to mitigate risk.`,

  {
    que: "Is copy trading allowed?",
    ans: `Trade Copying Policies:<br/><br/>
You are allowed to copy trades from your personal account, another account, or even between
multiple Hera Trading Capital accounts, as well as between your funded account and evaluation
account, provided that these are your own trades from your own accounts.<br/><br/>
There is only one restriction:<br/><br/>
You cannot copy trades (or use the same trading strategies) between multiple Hera Trading
Capital evaluation accounts. Each evaluation must be completed independently to maintain the
integrity of the process.`,
  },
  {
    que: "Can I copy trades or trade as a team?",
    ans: `No, each trader is required to develop and use their own unique trading strategy. Team trading
or copying trades on our simulated platform is not permitted. Every trader is eligible to create
their own strategy with a starting balance of up to $300,000 in simulated funds.
It is a violation of our rules for multiple users to execute the same trades, as this would exceed
the maximum capital allocation per user`,
  },
  {
    que: "Can I use indicators or expert advisors when trading the Hera Trading Account?",
    ans: `Use of Expert Advisors (EAs):<br/><br/>
You are free to use any Expert Advisor (EA), as long as we do not observe multiple users
executing the same trades or strategies. Each trader is limited to one unique strategy. If multiple
users are found to be utilizing the same EA, it may result in account termination. While
third-party EAs are allowed, we strongly recommend that each trader use their own
custom-programmed EA.<br/><br/>
Please also note the server request limit: a maximum of 2,000 requests per day (including
modifications of TP/SL and orders), with a daily position limit of 2,000 trades.<br/><br/>
Hera Trading Capital does not limit or restrict any user's trading style or strategy, provided that:<br/><br/>
The trades are simulated legitimately.<br/>
The trades mirror real market conditions.<br/>
The trades could be replicated in our live capital accounts if necessary.<br/>
It's important to remember the following limits:<br/><br/>
Apart from these restrictions, you are free to trade any instruments and assets available on your
hypothetical trading platform, provided that risk is managed appropriately and all User
Objectives and Rules are followed`,

    que: "Can I hold positions overnight?",

Hera Trading Capital accounts. Since our simulated platform mirrors real market conditions,
please be aware of the risks associated with market gaps when trading instruments that do not
remain open during weekend trading hours, such as Forex pairs, Indices, and Commodities.<br/><br/>
As a trader, it is your responsibility to evaluate the risks and rewards of holding positions
overnight, as we do not impose restrictions on your trading strategy. However, if a gap, slippage,

consequences`,

    que: "Is there any Stop-loss rule?",
    ans: `We do not require the use of stop losses or take profits; their implementation is entirely at your
discretion based on your trading strategy.<br/><br/>
However, data consistently shows that traders who utilize stop losses tend to achieve greater
long-term success compared to those who do not. For this reason, we highly recommend
incorporating stop losses into your trading approach.`,

Is it possible to get a refund if my account is terminated for risking my entire balance on a single
trade?<br/><br/>
Risking your entire account balance on a single trade is strictly prohibited and goes against our
terms. Trading strategies that involve excessive risk-taking may result in account termination.
Our refund policy states, all sales are final, and no refunds will be issued.<br/><br/>
Is hedging across multiple accounts allowed, and will I get a refund if my account is terminated
for doing so?<br/><br/>
Hedging across multiple accounts, including those under the same trader, is strictly prohibited.
Opening opposing positions on the same asset goes against fair trading practices and
compromises the platform's integrity. Violations of this policy may result in account suspension
or termination. Refunds are not guaranteed and will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.`,
  },
  {
    que: "Can I use Expert Advisors (EAs) on my account?",
    ans: `Yes, you can use Expert Advisors (EAs) on your account, but the same strategy cannot be
executed by multiple users. To ensure fairness, each trader is allowed to use only one unique
strategy. If we detect multiple users using the same EA, your account may be terminated.
Refunds are not guaranteed and will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Additionally, there is
a server request limit of 2000 actions per day, including TP/SL modifications and order changes,

  {
    que: "What happens if I execute large trades without a strategy or proper risk management?",
    ans: `Executing large trades without a clear strategy or ignoring essential market analysis and risk
management principles is considered misuse of the simulated environment. This behavior will
be penalized, as it does not represent genuine trading practices and leads to inaccurate trading
data.<br/><br/>
Independent Evaluation Protocol<br/>
Each trading evaluation must be completed independently. It is strictly prohibited to copy trades,
whether manually or using EAs, from one account to another, including transferring trades from
a master account to an evaluation account. This policy applies to both individual trades and
entire trading strategies.<br/><br/>
Account Management After Evaluation<br/>
After successfully passing the evaluation, you can manage up to $300,000 in funded accounts
at Hera Trading Capital. You are also allowed to copy trades between your funded account and
one evaluation account. If you use a trade copier, you must be able to verify ownership of both
accounts involved in the copying process.`,
  },
  {
    que: "Can I trade during news events?",
    ans: `Yes, traders are allowed to place trades during news events across Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the
evaluation for all account types at Hera Trading Capital. However, please be aware that our
simulated platform closely tracks real-world market data, and news events often involve high
volatility, increasing the risk of slippage.<br/><br/>
Trading during news events does not violate Hera Trading Capital's evaluation rules. However,
traders must understand that slippage—similar to live market conditions—can occur. Any
slippage that leads to a breach of the maximum loss limits is the trader's responsibility.
Hera Trading Capital cannot guarantee profits during these high-risk events, nor can we prevent
potential losses if a trade fails to execute as expected or is impacted by slippage, affecting the
performance of your simulated account.<br/><br/>
As our platform mirrors live market conditions, we recommend exercising caution and
considering the risks when trading during major news events to better manage potential losses.`,

Capital evaluation accounts. Each evaluation must be completed independently to uphold the
integrity of the evaluation process.`,

  {
    que: "Can I copy trades or trade as a team?",

or copying trades on our simulated platform is not permitted. Each trader is eligible to create
their own strategy with a starting balance of up to $300,000 in hypothetical funds.<br/><br/>
Executing the same trades across multiple users constitutes a violation of our rules, as it would
exceed the maximum capital allocation per user.
