    que: "What are prohibited trading strategies?",
    ans: `For Hera Trading Capital, the following trading practices are strictly prohibited:<br/><br/>
1. Unrealistic Trading Opportunities: This includes exploiting unrealistic prices or trade
opportunities such as arbitrage, latency exploitation, All or
Nothing (trading without proper
risk management), front-running price feeds, or any
mispricing tactics.<br/>
2. Latency Trading: Trading based on latency advantages is not allowed.<br/>
3. Arbitrage Trading: Engaging in arbitrage trading methods is prohibited.<br/>
4. High-Frequency Trading (HFT): High-frequency trading practices are not permitted.<br/>
5. Reverse Trading Hedging: Strategies involving reverse trading or group
hedging are disallowed.<br/>
6. Order Book Spamming: Manipulating the order book by spamming is strictly prohibited.<br/><br/>
Additionally, account management services are not allowed. All accounts and trades must be
conducted by the individual whose name is on the account.<br/><br/>If you're uncertain about whether your EA or manual scalping strategy is compliant, please
reach out to us before you start trading.<br/><br/>For traders aiming for a qualified analyst account up to $300,000, it is critical to thoroughly
understand these rules, objectives, and requirements to maximize your success with us.<br/><br/>Order Book Spamming Defined<br/><br/>
Order book spamming is a manipulative trading tactic where a trader places a large number of
orders in the order book to give the false appearance of high market activity or certain price
trends. This practice aims to mislead other traders by creating artificial pressure, potentially
influencing their trading decisions.<br/><br/>Reasons for Prohibiting Order Book Spamming<br/>
1. Unfair Advantage: By using this tactic, traders can gain an unfair edge over others,
especially in a simulated environment where the consequences are less immediate than
in live trading. This undermines both the fairness and the integrity of the trading platform.<br/>
2. System Strain: Excessive orders put significant pressure on trading platforms, leading
to system delays, decreased performance, and potential instability in market operations.
This disrupts trading efficiency for all users, resulting in slower response times and a
poorer experience overall.<br/><br/>Prohibiting order book spamming helps maintain a level playing field, ensuring both market
integrity and optimal system performance.<br/><br/>At Hera Trading Capital, we enforce strict measures to maintain a fair and compliant trading
environment. Violating any of our policies will result in the following actions:<br/>1. Immediate Termination: Hera Trading Capital reserves the right to terminate your
account and agreement immediately if any prohibited trading practice is detected.<br/>
2. Forfeiture of Profits: Any profits generated through prohibited practices will be
considered void and will not be distributed.<br/>
3. Evaluation Review and Disqualification: All passed evaluations are subject to review.`,

Is it possible to get a refund if my account is terminated for risking my entire balance on a single
trade?<br/><br/>

Is hedging across multiple accounts allowed, and will I get a refund if my account is terminated
for doing so?<br/><br/>
Hedging across multiple accounts, including those under the same trader, is strictly prohibited.

    que: "How Does the Bi-Weekly Payout Structure Work?",
    ans: `Bi-Weekly Payout Structure:<br/><br/>  At Hera Trading Capital, we process payouts for our funded
          traders on a bi-weekly basis. Traders can request their payout
          starting on the 14th day from reaching funded status. However,
          to ensure active and consistent trading, traders are expected to
          generate at least 0.75% profit on their account balance for 7 out of the 14 days
          leading up to their payout request. There is no cap on payout amounts</strong>, meaning
          traders can withdraw as much profit as they have accumulated.
          This policy applies equally to both 1-step and 2-step funded accounts.<br/><br/> Why This Rule Is Necessary <br/><br/>
          1) Prevents One-Time Lucky Trades - By setting a condition for consistent profitability, this rule helps
          distinguish skilled traders from those who may have achieved a large profit from a single high-risk trade. <br/><br/>
          2) Aligns with Prop Firm Standards - The top-tier prop firms have similar payout structures to maintain a sustainable model while keeping payouts frequent and fair for traders. <br/><br/>
          3) Incentivizes Smart Risk Management - Traders who aim for steady returns rather than high-risk, high-reward strategies are more likely to succeed long-term, benefiting both the trader and the firm.`,
