        </GoldenText>
        <p className="text-AmericanSilver font-ClashGroteskLight">
          2.1. Once your registration is complete, you will gain access to the
          Affiliate Program section. This area provides essential tools and
          resources, including your unique Affiliate Links and promotional
          banners, to help you promote Hera Trading Capital effectively.
          <br />
          <br />
          2.2. Affiliates are required to promote Hera Trading Capital's
          products solely using the official Affiliate Links and/or Banners
          provided within the Affiliate Program section. Using unauthorized
          tools, links, or codes is strictly prohibited and will be considered a
          material breach of this Agreement. If the Affiliate promotes the
          program on any external platform, Hera Trading Capital reserves the
          right to review the platform both during and after the registration
          process. We may, at our sole discretion, deny the use of Affiliate
          Links and/or Banners on any platform that we deem unsuitable.
          <br />
          <br />
          2.3. Our system tracks visitors through the use of cookies. For the
          visitor to be linked to the Affiliate's account, they must consent to
          the use of cookies when redirected via the Affiliate Link. The
          successful association of the visitor with the affiliate is contingent
          on this consent, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
          Hera Trading Capital cannot control the visitor's decision to accept
          or reject cookies and is not liable for any failed tracking due to
          cookie rejections. Each cookie is valid for 90 days and applies only
          to the browser used during the initial visit through the Affiliate
          Link or Banner.
          <br />
          <br />
          2.4. If the visitor clears their browser cache or history, the cookie
          and tracking information will be erased. On future visits, the visitor
          will need to consent to cookie tracking again for the affiliate
          connection to be reestablished.

          redirects them to Hera Trading Capital's website.
          <br />

          tracking.
          <br />
          3.1.3. Using the active browser cookies, the visitor must create a
          user account on Hera Trading Capital's website within 90 calendar days
          from the initial visit facilitated by the Affiliate Link or Banner.
          <br />
          3.1.4. The visitor must successfully register, make their first
          payment, and transition into a customer referred by the affiliate.
          <br />
          3.1.5. The customer must either:
          <br />
          ● Not use any discount code, or
          <br />
          ● Use a discount code provided by the same affiliate whose link or
          banner they initially clicked, or
          <br />
          ● Use a discount code officially issued by Hera Trading Capital
          through an approved campaign or promotion.
          <br />
          3.1.6. If the visitor uses one affiliate's link or banner but applies
          another affiliate's discount code during purchase, the commission will
          not be awarded.

          3.1.7. The agreement between the customer and Hera Trading Capital

          4. Affiliate Reward Conditions
        </GoldenText>
        <p className="text-AmericanSilver font-ClashGroteskLight">
          4.1. No reward will be provided for referred customers if they cannot
          be attributed to you due to any of the following reasons:
          <br />
          ● (i) The visitor refuses to enable cookies.
          <br />
          ● (ii) The visitor uses a different web browser to create their
          account than the one used to access Hera Trading Capital's website via
          your Affiliate Link or Banner.
          <br />
          ● (iii) The visitor creates an account more than 90 calendar days
          after acquiring the cookie.
          <br />
          ● (iv) The visitor deletes or deactivates the cookie.
          <br />
          ● (v) The customer requests a refund, invalidating your commission
          eligibility.
          <br />
          4.2. To avoid misunderstandings, affiliates are not eligible for
          rewards simply by promoting Hera Trading Capital or its products
          (e.g., sharing affiliate links or banners). A reward is only granted
          if all the conditions outlined in this agreement are fulfilled.
          <br />
          4.3. Commission withdrawals can be made by submitting a request
          through the affiliate platform. The 'Request Payment' button will only
          be available once the affiliate has met the eligibility requirements
          for withdrawal as specified in these Terms and Conditions.
          <br />
          4.4. If a discount coupon provided to the affiliate remains unused by
          any customer for 90 consecutive days, it will be automatically
          deactivated.

          <br />
          ● (iii) Affiliates are not allowed to engage with customers from
          restricted jurisdictions or use our services for illegal activities

          <br />
          ● (ii) Automated actions such as forced browser redirects, pop-ups,
          pop-unders, or embedding our web pages within an iframe are forbidden.
          Techniques like cookie background-fetching or using cookies without

          <br />
          5.5. Compensation for Breaches: If you breach these terms, you will be
